# Hybrid Experimental-Data-Driven Framework

This repository is an early-stage, exploratory project focused on understanding how experimental data and machine-learning methods can be combined to guide alloy design for ultrafast photodetectors.

For ternary alloys, the number of possible compositions grows quickly, making it unrealistic to rely on experiments alone. The goal of this work is to review and gradually build a workflow that brings together structured experimental data, Python-based analysis and visualization, and generative machine-learning ideas to help narrow down promising composition spaces.
